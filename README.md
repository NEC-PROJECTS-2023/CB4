About Project:
  1. Efficient Traffic Sign Recognition with Deep Neural Networks is a Deep Learning project which is used for Traffic Sign Detection. Convolutional Neural Networks          model is used in this project and the neural network model can be found in the model.ipynb file.
  2. The dataset used for training this model is GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset which can be found in kaggle. The link for the dataset is as        follows: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign
  3. Flask application is used as frontend for the project to upload an image and produce the result. The code for the Flask app can be found in app.py present in the        frontend folder.
